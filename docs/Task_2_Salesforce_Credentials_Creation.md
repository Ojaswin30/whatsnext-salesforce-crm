# Task 1 Report: Salesforce Developer Account Setup

---

## 1. Objective

The goal of this task was to create and activate a Salesforce Developer account in order to access the Salesforce Developer Org. This setup is essential for beginning development and testing of Salesforce applications.

---

## 2. Steps Performed

### Creating a Developer Account

I started by visiting the Salesforce Developer signup page at [https://developer.salesforce.com/signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup). On the signup form, I entered my personal and organizational details as follows:

- First Name and Last Name  
- Email Address  
- Selected Role as **Developer**  
- Company name as my collegeâ€™s name  
- Country set to **India**  
- Postal code entered as per my location  
- For the username, I created a unique combination using my name and college, following the required email format (e.g., `ojaswin@college.com`). I noted that this email address need not be a real email but should follow the format.

After carefully filling out all the required fields, I submitted the form by clicking the **Sign Me Up** button.

### Account Activation

After submitting the form, I waited for the verification email to arrive in my inbox (this took around 5 to 10 minutes). Once received, I opened the email and clicked the **Verify Account** link to activate my Salesforce Developer Org account.

Following the link, I was prompted to set a password and answer a security question for account recovery. After completing these steps and clicking **Change Password**, I was successfully redirected to my Salesforce Developer Org setup page.

## 3. Accessing the Developer Org

The URL for my Salesforce Developer Org is:  
[https://orgfarm-b97cdb323c-dev-ed.develop.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home](https://orgfarm-b97cdb323c-dev-ed.develop.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home)

This link takes me directly to the Salesforce Lightning homepage of my developer org, where I can start building and customizing applications.

## 4. Notes and Observations

- Since I already had an existing Salesforce Developer account, I realized I did not need to create a new one. However, for the sake of practice and documentation, I went through the process again.
- The verification email can take some time to arrive, so patience is required.
- The username must be unique across Salesforce, so sometimes the suggested username might need slight modifications.
- The activation process is straightforward, and the redirect to the Setup page happens immediately after setting the password.

## 5. Conclusion

Completing this task provided me with the necessary access and credentials to work in the Salesforce Developer environment. It sets the foundation for further tasks involving Salesforce customization, development, and automation.
